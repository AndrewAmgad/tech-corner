# Tech Corner
Development in progress
## Introduction

Tech Corner is a platform that allows users to buy & sell their tech products such as laptops, gaming consoles, accessories and more. It is basically a personal project of mine that I develop within my free time. It is built using NodeJS, Express & MongoDB in the back-end and ReactJS, Redux & Material UI in the front-end.
The project is still undergoing slow-development.

## Project's Main Concerns
- Clean code structure, allowing for ease of development & modifications.
- Modern & responsive design that adapts to all devices and screen sizes.
- Compatiable with system-wide dark mood settings.
- Snappy & stable UI.

## Implemented Features
- JWT Authentication with always logged in feature using access & refresh tokens.
- AWS S3 back-end integration for file upload
- Home page's infinite scrolling using automatic pagination
- Sell an item page with real-time image upload preview & validation

## Work in Progress
- Database searching for products
- Real-time messaging between buyers & sellers
- User notifications
- Categores & Favorites pages
